## Planning

Once the team settled on an idea for an application Nick volunteered to be begin planning the data structure. First drafts of the models and page contents were sketched out with pen and paper.

With rough ideas on paper, Nick set to work creating wireframes and user workflows in a drawio to share with the team. The data was beginning to take shape and with it somoe of the UX!

Asana was critical to our project managment process. Tasks were frontloaded and updated as idenitfied. We've got big plans for future development!
